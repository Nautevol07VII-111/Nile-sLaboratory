                        <p>I am a self-taught painter and audio-engineer, but these days, I spend most of my time <a target="_blank" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/Nautevol07VII-111/aLaboratory">coding</a>. I started my coding journey because I am fascinated by the idea of bridging the gap between technology and fine art, while still keeping the artistic aspect authentic. I aim to apply everything I've learned from the arts to solve complex problems creatively. I look forward to working and striving in the field of tech because technology is constantly evolving; and like change, growth is also constant.</p>

                        <p> During my time at codeDifferently I learned how to build real world applications using an accelerated SPRINT method. Some of the applications I built include CSV parsers, bank atm features, simple grade checkers,an interactive game called <a target="_blank" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/nilejack/24q4-team2/tree/main">numMeCrazy</a> and much more. In addition to learning how to learn in an efficient manner, I was able to obtain another valuable skill; namely, how to optimize my learning process in group settings through collaborative learning. With a collective approach to abstracting complex concepts I was able to not only help myself, but my team members as well. Working in a collaborative environment also enhanced my soft skills.</p>
